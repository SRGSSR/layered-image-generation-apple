Layered image (.lsr) generation fix for tvOS
============================================

Apple TV applications can display layered images, stored as `.lsr` files, basically a zip of all layers with JSON metadata describing them (size, relative, position, color profile, etc.). More information is available from the [official documentation](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/Xcode/Reference/xcode_ref-Asset_Catalog_Format/LSRFormatOverview.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40015170-CH44-SW1).

[Up to five layers](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/Xcode/Reference/xcode_ref-Asset_Catalog_Format/LSRFormatOverview.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40015170-CH44-SW1) can be supplied with sRGB or P3 color profiles, and in normal "@1x" or @2x scale (there is no @1x, but we use this shortcut in the following). Which variants must be provided depends on the use case, for example icon specifications are provided in the [tvOS Human Interface Guidelines](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/tvos/icons-and-images/app-icon/):

- The app icon is a 400 x 240 layered image, with a 400px x 240px @1x sRGB variant, and a 800x480px @2x sRGB (or P3 if possible) variant for each layer. Each layer must be a PNG.
- The App Store icon is a 1280px Ã— 768 layered image with a 1280px x 768px @1x sRGB variant and an optional P3 variant (most notably if you used P3 for the app icon, so that both look the same). Each layer must be a PNG.

### Tools

Apple provides a toolset for `.lsr` image generation on its [resource page](https://developer.apple.com/design/resources/):

- [tvOS design resources](https://developer.apple.com/design/downloads/tvOS-11-Photoshop.dmg) containing a layered template for icon design.
- [A Photoshop exporter](https://itunespartner.apple.com/assets/downloads/ParallaxExporter_Apps.zip) to generate an `.lsr` from official templates right within Photoshop. This exporter namely relies on the naming of the root layer which must be kept as is so that content is correctly found and identified (individual layers can apparently be freely named).
- [Parallax Previewer](http://itunespartner.apple.com/assets/downloads/Parallax%20Previewer.dmg) to check an `.lsr` or merge two `.lsr` files into one and export the result.

Documentation is available as PDF files in these `dmg` installers. Note that the Photoshop exporter generates a single variant for each layer (@1x sRGB, @2x P3 or @2x sRGB). Creating an app icon according to the above specifications therefore requires two exports and a merge in Parallax Previewer.

### Fixing the tools

Sadly these tools are buggy and not updated since a long time:

- The Photoshop exporter generates incorrect `.lsr` size and position metadata. For a merge between @1x and @2x resources to be successful, canvas sizes, positions and dimensions specified in the `.lsr` files to be merged must match and correspond to the asset size (without scaling which is an artifact of pixel density). For a @2x resource, the current exporter incorrectly multiplies all dimensions by 2, making the merge for an app icon impossible.
- The Photoshop exporter declares layers as `universal`, but it is better to declare them as `tv` so that Xcode displays only TV images (other platforms are not relevant).
- The Parallax Previewer does not recognize the constant `display-P3` which a single P3 Photoshop export generates. When merging such a resource, the Parallax Previewer replaces its type with sRGB in the final `.lsr`, which is incorrect.
- The Parallax Previewer tool incorrectly provides `srgb` and `display-p3` as color profiles in exported `.lsr` files, but Xcode understands only `sRGB` and `display-P3`. When imported into an Xcode resource catalog, resources generate warnings. Though this seems to work, avoiding warnings is always better.

To fix these issues:

1. Replace with administrator rights the `/Applications/Adobe Photoshop 2020/Plug-ins/Generator/lsr-generator/png_generator.js` file with the one supplied in this repository. The path will change between Photoshop versions but since I am not Photoshop user I don't know whether there is a pattern to script it. This file:
	- Fixes size and position by dividing them by the image scale.
   - Replaces `universal` with `tv`.
   - Since the Parallax Previewer secretly recognizes `displayp3` for P3 color profile, and since a single exported P3 resource is not really useful without being merged, we it uses this value for P3 output.
2. To fix the profile constants generated by the Parallax Previewer which Xcode does not understand, patch the binary with the following terminal command, valid for version 1.0.3:
	```
	printf 'display-P3' | dd of="/Applications/Parallax Previewer.app/Contents/MacOS/Parallax Previewer" bs=1 seek=137864 count=10 conv=notrunc; printf 'sRGB' | dd of="/Applications/Parallax Previewer.app/Contents/MacOS/Parallax Previewer" bs=1 seek=138073 count=4 conv=notrunc
	```
	A similar command is easy to generate for other versions (though I doubt updates will be delivered) by simply looking for the `srgb` and `display-p3` strings in the binary with a hex editor, and updating the offests where the values are located.

### Exporting an app icon

To export an app icon, e.g. with the best setup sRGB@1x and P3@2x:

- Use the sRGB normal template to design the icon and use the exporter to get the corresponding `.lsr`.
- Use the P3 @2x template to design the high resolution variant and use the exporter to get a second corresponding `.lsr`.
- Open the first `.lsr` with the Parallax Previewer tool.
- Use File > Merge to merge the second `.lsr` into the first one. Each layer should have a normal and high quality variant you can switch between.
- Use File > Export > LSR... to export the merged `.lsr`, which can then be dragged and dropped onto an Xcode asset catalog. No warnings should be displayed and all resources should be in place with correct color profile.

### Exporting an App Store icon

To export an App Store icon, e.g. with the best setup sRGB@ and SRGB:

- Use the sRGB normal template to design the icon and use the exporter to get the corresponding `.lsr`.
- Use the P3 normal template to design the P3 variant and use the exporter to get a second corresponding `.lsr`.
- Open the first `.lsr` with the Parallax Previewer tool.
- Use File > Merge to merge the second `.lsr` into the first one. Each layer should have a normal and high quality variant you can switch between.
- Use File > Export > LSR... to export the merged `.lsr`, which can then be dragged and dropped onto an Xcode asset catalog. No warnings should be displayed and all resources should be in place with correct color profile.
